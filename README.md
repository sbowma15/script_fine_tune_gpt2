# script_fine_tune_gpt2

This Python script demonstrates the process of fine-tuning the GPT-2 model for creative script generation. The fine-tuning utilizes the transformers library and requires the installation of various dependencies such as torch, torchvision, pandas, matplotlib, numpy, nltk, seaborn, sklearn, gensim, pyldavis, wordcloud, textblob, spacy, and textstat.

# Overview

The script follows these key steps:

Fine-tuning the GPT-2 model with creative script data.
Training the model and optimizing hyperparameters.
Generating creative script outputs based on the fine-tuned model.
Adjust hyperparameters, epochs, and other settings in the script according to your specific requirements.
